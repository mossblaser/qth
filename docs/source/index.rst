Qth: A home automation focused layer on MQTT
============================================

Qth is a set of conventions for using `MQTT (Message Queue Telemetry Transport)
<http://mqtt.org/>`_ as the backbone of a home automation system.  These conventions were
inspired by `SHET (SHET Home Event Tunnelling) <https://github.com/18sg/shet>`_, the asynchronous communication
framework used by the hacked-together home automation system in `my old student
house <http://18sg.github.io/>`_.
